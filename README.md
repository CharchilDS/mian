# Brain tumour detection and classification is that the most troublesome and tedious task within the space of medicative image getting ready. 
MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) may be a medicative procedure, typically adopted by the medical specialist for illustration of inner structure of the build with no surgery.
 MRI provides long information concerning the human delicate tissue, that helps within the conclusion of brain tumour. Precise segmentation of MRI image is basic for the conclusion of brain tumour by laptop supported clinical device. 
This project is concentrated towards the look of Associate in Nursing best and additional correct approach for the detection of neoplasm from brain magnetic resonance imaging scans and if it confirms the presence of tumour then it's focused on evaluating its stage, i.e., benign or malignant(glioma , meningioma, pituitary )  




# Methodology
The classification modeling is done by designing deep learning CNN architecture and transfer learning mechanism.
A convolutional neural network (CNN ) is a network architecture forÂ deep learning which learns directly from data, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction.
CNNs are particularly useful for finding patterns in images to recognize objects, faces, and scenes. They can also be quite effective for classifying non-image data such as audio, time series, and signal data.)


# Conclusion

In this project, we have proposed different styles of CNN architectures and compared their performance for brain tumor classification.
 First we started with very simple architecture and recorded its accuracy and then the model is tuned by adjusting hyper parameter and increasing number of filters and layers.
 The results show that adjustment of hyper parameters increases the accuracy of CNN model. Further model accuracy was increased by using EffecientNet .
The use of transfer learning mechanism shows significant improvement in accuracy and F1 score of tumor classification model
